# Wick Project

Django Web-App that allows users to register and login where users are stored in an SQL table guided by a User Django model.

Administrators have access to create new users, edit all users, and delete users.

To log on as an administrator on my example use the following login information:
Username : admin 
Password : iamtheadmin
